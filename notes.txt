Notes:

"For longer sounds, such as music soundtracks, streaming should be used with the audio element and MediaElementAudioSourceNode." - http://www.w3.org/TR/webaudio/#AudioContext-section

Section loops could be implemented using the existing loop, loopStart, loopEnd parameters in start().  "the AudioBuffer is at a specific sample-rate (usually the same as the AudioContext sample-rate), and that the loop times (in seconds) must be converted to the appropriate sample-frame positions in the buffer according to this sample-rate." - http://www.w3.org/TR/webaudio/#looping-AudioBufferSourceNode

This doesn't have many methods.  I think we manipulate the underlying 
"HTMLMediaElement.currentTime
The current playback time, in seconds. Setting this value seeks the media to the new time.""

A self-closed script tag <script src="foo.js" /> will cause silent failure.
Forgetting to return something an a list.map(function(elem)) { elem; }); will give you null back instead of a "collected" list.
