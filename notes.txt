Notes:

"For longer sounds, such as music soundtracks, streaming should be used with the audio element and MediaElementAudioSourceNode." - http://www.w3.org/TR/webaudio/#AudioContext-section

This doesn't have many methods.  I think we manipulate the underlying 
"HTMLMediaElement.currentTime
The current playback time, in seconds. Setting this value seeks the media to the new time.""
