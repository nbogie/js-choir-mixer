* allow mute buttons to be changed even when the gain nodes they affect are stale or non-existent.

* make a list of positions.

* solo buttons for each part (radio button?)

* click snapshot position to jump to that position

* drop the overall gain when as more tracks are added.

maybe:
=======

* advance the position slider while the piece plays?

* If playing, changes to the position slider immediately play at that point.

DONE:
======
* re-apply mute-button states to sources once they've been re-created (e.g. on seek, pause, etc)
