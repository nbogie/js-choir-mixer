* volume changes on muted tracks should consult track mute state and only affect track gain if not muted.  

*on creation/play, sync not only with mute states but volume sliders.

* allow mute buttons to be changed even when the gain nodes they affect are stale or non-existent.

* solo buttons for each part (radio button?)

* drop the overall gain when as more tracks are added.

* visualise each track.

* add a radix of 10 to calls to parseInt, to prevent leading zeros on numbers changing their base for interpretation.

maybe:
=======

* advance the position slider while the piece plays?

* If playing, changes to the position slider immediately play at that point.

DONE:
======
* re-apply mute-button states to sources once they've been re-created (e.g. on seek, pause, etc)

* make a list of positions.

* click snapshot position to jump to that position
